@@1378524 <p> Clariden Leu enhanced its focus on Asia in 2009 , in the wake of the financial crisis . How was the year and how did the crisis impact your business ? There has been a paradigm shift in the fundamental values of the private banking business . With the onset of the economic recovery , we have seen a greater level of focus on trust , relationship and clients ' needs . These are actually basic principles and consistent with the philosophy at Clariden Leu . I can honestly say that we have never shifted away from these basics . <p> Having said that , wealth creation continues at a healthy pace in Asia and in support of this we 've enhanced our focus in the region over the past months and have expanded our staff strength . <p> What is your outlook for the Asian private banking industry this year ? Asia is undeniably the fastest growing private banking region in the world and at the same time , Asian UHNWI ultra-high-net-worth individuals are highly sophisticated and want to be close to their relationship managers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for high-calibre client advisers , who are truly wealth managers . Today there is a shortage of such professionals and I see the industry already putting into place significant measures to identify , train and retain such talent . This will continue for some time as the market continues to grow and mature . At the same time , all private banks must continually reassess and align their market strategy with the evolving needs of their clients and prospects in the region . <p> Furthermore , I expect an increasing diversity within the financial landscape as it continues to evolve with different types of financial advisors/wealth management providers entering the market in the coming months . We may see a new force of highly-focused banks competing in Asia , especially in the key wealth management hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong . Where an industry is growing , I expect to see a continuing trend of strategic moves by senior professionals . <p> How do you see the competitive landscape in the private banking industry in 2010 ? Which firms do you benchmark yourself against ? In Asia , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to come . In addition , ' pure play/highly focused ' banks like us are the ones to look out for this year as client relevance and quality advice becomes imperative above anything else . Asia has the highest projected growth on a CAGR compound annual growth rate basis . <p> Do you think clients in Asia are more open , after the crisis , to using a boutique firm such as Clariden Leu for their wealth management needs , as opposed to a full-service bank or a larger firm ? What distinguishes Clariden Leu from its competitors ? There are two aspects to this question . First and foremost , Clariden Leu is not a tiny little bank . We are the fifth largest Swiss private bank with a strong heritage that dates all the way back to 1755 . We distinguish ourselves from our competitors by our unique service -- despite our size , we act as a boutique private bank and offer a unique advice experience to our clients . <p> A number of private banks are expanding currently . Are you finding it challenging to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned earlier , talented staff is hard to find and I expect this to continue throughout the year . Having said that , I am proud to tell you that we have identified and recruited some excellent people . <p> Has there been a significant change in the way Asian high-net-worth individuals are investing after the financial crisis ? An Asian HNWI client is a highly sophisticated investor with a profound knowledge of the financial markets . Following the crisis , we feel that clients are increasingly demanding a comprehensive range of services that go far beyond traditional wealth management and the provision of investment advice . This spectrum of services spans financial and tax advice , succession and inheritance planning , questions of financing and insurance , and advice on corporate purchases .

Zhang must be wondering . <p> Associated Press <p> The celebrity 's trouble began on the Internet late last month , when a post on the popular Tianya site reported that Zhang had donated just 840,000 yuan to quake relief , or 160,000 yuan less than promised .

@@1392824 <h> The Mystery of China 's Labor Shortage <p> For a country which still has significant surplus labor , the reportedly severe shortage of migrant workers in China 's economic engines such as the Pearl River Delta after the Lunar New Year holiday is rather baffling . <p> Various domestic media reports put the labor supply gap at around a million people in Guangzhou and neighboring cities such as Dongguan , legendary centers of China 's export boom in the past three decades . Numerous assembly lines and construction sites are sitting idle while anxious employers have raised salaries by more than 30% but still ca n't attract enough applicants . <p> Structural unemployment -- a mismatch between the skills workers have and those sought by employers -- does n't fully explain the phenomenon . To answer the question , one needs to consider a combination of factors that symbolize the changing landscape of China 's labor force and modern society in general . <p> Firstly , there is indeed a structural problem here and it 's twofold : On the one hand , many of the outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as segments of China 's export industry crawl up the value chain ; but on the other hand , some factories complain that lots of the new-generation migrant workers are n't interested in tough basic jobs like construction any more . <p> The lack of interest in such low-paying , physically demanding work partly stems from the second factor -- the growing income at home for these farmers . Much to its credit , the Chinese government has consistently put developing agriculture and feeding the rural population ( which measured 727.5 million in 2007 ) as its top priority over the years . An incessant stream of favorable policies , such as scrapping burdensome taxes and forceful market intervention , have increased rural incomes to the extent that farming is becoming more rewarding than cleaning skyscraper windows in some places . <p> China 's little-noticed reform to allow large state enterprises to rent farmland from peasants in order to modernize farming and boost productivity has started reaping fruits and also created a burgeoning group of idle farmers who can afford to live on their handsome rental income . <p> Thirdly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas is partly due to the construction boom and fast economic growth in second-tier inland cities such as Chongqing , Wuhan and Nanchang . Many migrant workers prefer these places because salaries are in some cases almost on par with Shanghai 's and it 's simply closer to home . <p> Lastly , a fairly qualitative but nonetheless significant observation is that just like in China 's urban areas , the young generation of the rural population seems to have taken on a different world view . While their parents -- migrant workers in their late 40s or early 50s -- are gradually returning home and fading from the scene , their children who have been raised in relatively good conditions , are under much less pressure to support themselves or their ( smaller ) families . <p> " I am no longer willing to put up with the hardship in the city like my father did , " a young man told a local newspaper . With the savings of their parents who have struggled for decades in the cities , their family members in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy electronic appliances and enjoy a decent life . <p> Putting all this into long-term perspective , the current problem offers a glimpse of the likely more massive labor shortage issue that China is set to face in the next few decades as its single-child policy keeps accelerating the aging of its still-enormous population . That indeed is one of China 's major dilemmas . <h> Comments ( 5 of 25 ) <p> It is interesting to see you guys talking about China , most of the comments makes sense . I am in Shenzhen and work in a trading company , the reality in China 's economy is : China is trying to become independant in economic development , but not yet . China 's economy seems awesome , but it is not , it is just because there are some many diligent people in China , but these great Chinese labours got 1 percent of their due share of benefit while the rest of the chain get 99% , the rest of the chain includes : A.retailers in the West : carrefour , walmart , home depot , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% , B the importers , takes around 10-15% , C the transport /shipping companies , etc. , smaller share maybe 5-10% , D , the Chinese government , takes around 20% , E , Chinese cadres , they get around 5% through all kinds of illegal means . F. factory owners , 4% , This of course if not precise , but I think is about how the benefit are shared for these commodies made in China . Personally , I am a son of peasants , and like many of my peers , I love peasants ' most personalities : diligency , frugality , hard-working , but I do n't like one of the character of the peasants : too obedient .... All the world benefit from such obedience , but no one respect them because of this , what an irony . <p> 5:09 pm March 1 , 2010 <p> Fabian Knopf wrote : <p> I always love how China is trying to escape from the consequences of their actions .

@@1394256 <h> Artists Protest Demolition Threats <p> Beijing-based artists are finding themselves under attack from the forces of urban development and some are staging increasingly public protests to fight back . <p> On Monday , a small group of artists held a brief demonstration near Tiananmen Square to protest the planned demolition of " artists ' villages " in Beijing and the alleged harassment of a group of artists by bat- and knife-wielding thugs . <p> Sky Canaves <p> Beijing 's 798 Art District ( pictured above ) is a hit with tourists , but other creative communities are under threat <p> Monday 's protesters included several residents of the Zhengyang Creative Art Zone and the 008 Art District in northeastern Bejiing , who said they had been assaulted by a group of armed attackers early Monday morning while holding a meeting to discuss the future of their neighborhoods . Also marching ( and Twittering http : //twitter.com/aiww throughout ) was artist/provocateur Ai Weiwei , who pioneered the development of the nearby Caochangdi art district , which is now home to numerous high-profile galleries and has also been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than 10 officers had been dispatched to handle the protesters . Ai described the police as " pretty rational " and the artists appear to have been dispersed without further incident . <p> According to a report in the English-language edition of the Global Times , the Zhengyang artists have been under pressure from local authorities and property developers since last July , even though some artists still had valid leases . Those pressures apparently came to a head early Monday , when a band of attackers clad in masked and military-style overcoats descended on the area , armed with bats , knives and steel rods . <p> Local officials could not be reached by The Wall Street Journal for comment Tuesday . According to the Global Times , Li Jiemin , the deputy party chief of Jinzhan township , where the Zhengyang and 008 art zones are located , said the township government had nothing to do with the incident and vowed that a police investigation would be launched . Chen Lianyuan , head of Chaoyang district , a larger administrative division , said that video cameras would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the artists and repair a fence damaged in the attack , according to the report . <p> Artists in the threatened communities had previously staged impromptu exhibitions and performances to express their opposition , but Monday 's protest marked the first time they took their complaints to downtown Beijing . <p> For years , creative types from around China have flocked to the capital , often settling in low-rent communities far from the city center . Beijing 's record on its art districts is mixed . The earliest major artists ' village , Yuanmingyuan , flourished in the years after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown , but was demolished in the mid-1990s . After initial uncertainty about its future , the 798 Art District , housed in a former Soviet-style munitions factory complex , has become a major tourist attraction , pushing some galleries and artists to seek alternative spaces such as Caochangdi . And even as some artistic communities are under threat , other areas are being actively developed as art districts with support from the government ( see , for example , this project in Songzhuang and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a property developer on the site of one of his residential developments ) . Whether artists will actually be able to afford to live there is another matter . <h> Comments ( 5 of 7 ) <p> Basically it 's a land grab . Eminent domain to the nth degree . sort of . The interest here is not one of public but of few interested parties . Due to recent decades rapid industrialization and urbanization in China , the value of lands have skyrocketed . Lots of this lands have unrealized potential values . If , an old farmer tears his house and builds a modern unit , he or she will capture this potential unrealized value . However , in this case and in most of the cases in developing countries ( this is still issue in S Korea ) including China , what happens is , instead of those residing the land , politically well connected developers end up capturing most if not all the unrealized value . With those who have been in the land being dislocated and moved further away from the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place is now is probably the largest transfer of public assets into private hands in history of mankind . One can package , color them differently . But , that is what it is . Is it being done in rational and fair way ? The answer will determinate the longetivity of today 's system . <p> and the reason this surely has gained attention of the guys at the top is the location of the incident . imagine times 100 or 1000 to what took place a few days ago .

In the video below , former motorcycle worker Li Lei performs " Bo Xilai 's Song , " a three-minute paean to the Chongqing chief .

@@1397098 <h> Related articles <p> China , are more and more seeking overseas coal . The unexpectedly massive onslaught of snow and ice in the country 's northern reaches has caused coal shortages in the southeast and is strengthening the determination of Chinese firms to go after overseas resources . As transportation from inland mines to the southeast coastal areas is also seriously short and coal prices are higher in domestic than in international markets , in the next few years economically developed areas in southeast China will be increasingly importing their coal . <p> On January 12 , the Metallurgical Corporation of China ( MCC ) announced that it will take a 5% stake for US$200 million in Resourcehouse , Ltd. , the parent company of China FirstPty , Ltd. , and get the general contract management of EPC , a ChinaFirst coal project in Queensland . <p> On February 6 , Resourcehouse , owned by Australia 's fifth wealthiest businessman Clive Palmer , announced that it had signed a coal trading contract worth US$60 billion with China Power International Development ( CPI ) .

Its southeastern coastal areas are gathering areas for coal imports . At the high end , prices for international supplies have been lower than for domestic coal . While it is easy to buy a good domestic coal mine with $3.2 billion , choosing to acquire Felix , say , makes sense because Felix has coal mines already in profitable operation . In China , the operation of a coal mine is limited by a variety of factors , such as the uncertainty of profits , even if the mine is in operation , due to capricious local policies , not to mention unlooked for intervention from Beijing . By contrast , Australia 's coal mine investment environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market operations and profits can be expected . <p> In recent years , negotiations between China 's coal and electric power suppliers have been deadlocked .

In return , MCC obtained the contracting right to shoulder the debt risk for Waratah Coal and can purchase 30 million tons of coal from the project per year . <p> On February 3 , MCC announced its acquisition of a 5% stake of Resourcehouse . Shen Heting , president of MCC , says that the company may get a project contract of $7 billion and may purchase 30 million tons of coal . <p> CIC 's investment has been rapid .

It is very difficult to obtain high-quality coal resources in domestic areas , so international acquisition or shareholding is the better choice . <p> Chinese enterprises get a lot of support from financial regulatory authorities and banks as they go abroad . The Ministry of Commerce , National Development and Reform Commission , and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange focus on supervision and support of Chinese enterprises ' overseas investment and M&amp;A activity . <p> YCM 's acquisition of Felix was an artful use of the country 's foreign exchange policy , adopting an " internal security " approach , referring to YCM 's guarantees to commercial banks , with foreign branches of China 's commercial banks providing loans to Yancoal Australia ( a YCM subsidiary ) , so that YCM had no need to use its own cash .

Shenhua has suspended coal export since December . <p> The hundreds of millions of tons of coal transportation in China each year put enormous pressure on railway transportation and is a great drag on social resources . The pattern of coal imports in the southern areas will help the transformation of " south import and north export .

The focus of this meeting was to set the use of imported coal as alternative in the period of shortage of domestic coal supply to ease the overall tense situation .
